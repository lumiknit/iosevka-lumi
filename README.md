# iosevka-lumi

My config for https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka.

## About settings

- Make bold weight bolder and light weight lighter
  - Keeping regular to 400, configured light = 200, medium = 600, bold = 900
- Upright fonts use straight strokes, and italic fonts use curves..
- Maximize width differences between narrow characters and wide characters for quasi-proportional font.
